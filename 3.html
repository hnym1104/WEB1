    <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, [6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interprited programming language. It is a language
      which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototyped-based multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS,
      JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. [7] JavaScript enables interactive
      web pages ans thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, [8] and all major
      web browers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
